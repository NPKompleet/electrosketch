# electrosketch
A WxPython based application for sketching and calculating electrical distribution planning. Uses graph theory and to make the calculations. Icons created in Blender

Project build with Python 2.6. Icons created using Blender and The Gimp

Main app interface is example8.py

It works by calculating the amount of materials needed for the construction of an electrical line just by placing poles in the interface.
Calculation is done automatically and an excel file can be created to generate the bill of materials

Project done to help Ikeja Electric in 2014. Still needs perfection though
